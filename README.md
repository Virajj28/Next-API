# Next-API
Learning about Next API routing.

# NextJS is a full-stack framework
You can write FE code in React and also write APIs that can be called by the front end code.
Within the pages folder, you need to create a folder called 'api'
Within that 'api' folder, you can define all the APIs for your application

# API routes allow you to create RestFul endpoints as part of your Next.js application folder.
